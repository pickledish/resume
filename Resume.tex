		\textbf{DATADOG} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Site Reliability Engineer \hfill May 20 -- Jun 23
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Planned and executed the migrations of some of Datadog's largest + most complicated services (the primary timeseries DB, the primary public LB) to Kubernetes, resulting in zero outages
			% \item Started MRE
			\item Identified 80/20 solutions in delivering delicate configuration to dozens of services simultaneously -- two months of work allowed a whole team over a year of space to design a real replacement
			\item Initiated several projects that crossed usual team/org boundaries -- harder, but we created Datadog-wide solutions where it really mattered
			\item Hosted architecture overview sessions, for 1-10 people, to help new hires feel empowered (instead of confused) as quickly as possible
			% \item Reviewed many design documents and pull requests, feedback included hard stuff like "we really just shouldn't do this"
			\item Acted as a consultant between infrastructure and product developers, and pushed stranded projects (like automated node rotation) to finish
			\item Contributed heavily to build/deployment tooling, so product developers could mostly ignore their services' 40+ Helm charts
			%\item Did all the usual ops stuff -- worked with cloud providers for instance capacity, improved resource utilization by binpacking containers, created TF modules, ran disaster tests, got way too familiar with Kafka
			%\item Did all the usual dev stuff -- created and deployed patches, optimized database sharding, participated in on call rotation, etc

		\textbf{ACTIONIQ} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Distributed Systems Engineer \hfill Jun 18 -- Apr 20
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Designed, advocated for, and implemented the procedure for autoscaling query execution on EC2, reducing our AWS bill by more than 50\%
			\item Drove scalability improvements for the OSS job scheduling platform Luigi, and contributed some of that back upstream
			\item Maintained the Prometheus cluster (later, Datadog) and led internal talks and workshops on best practices around metrics \& observability
			\item Enabled dynamic configuration and artifact discovery
			\item Brought some of the first Terraform modules to AIQ, used them to build \linebreak the first version of our streaming ingest platform using IaC

		\textbf{EDU.CHAT} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Software Engineering Intern \hfill Jun 17 -- Aug 17
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Worked closely with a team of three other engineers, using JIRA and Git, to create a bot which classified and answered student questions
			\item Developed, refined, tested and integrated the new NLP question-matching model with the overall Edu.Chat platform
			\item Learned Python implementations for message passing, parallelization and task queue systems to distribute the workload (like Celery and Redis)
