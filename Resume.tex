		\textbf{DATADOG} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Site Reliability Engineer \hfill May 20 -- Jun 23
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Planned and implemented the migrations of some of Datadog's largest and scariest services (the primary public-facing LB, the primary timeseries DB) to Kubernetes without incident
			\item Created Friends of MRE
			\item Identified 80/20 solutions for the delivery of some very important configuration, I did alone in 2mo to allow a whole team a year+ to design something nicer
			\item Reached beyond usual team boundaries to collaborate on important isolated projects when it really mattered (manifest diff, PM template, PRR)
			\item Hosted semi-frequent architecture overview sessions, for 1-10 people, to help enable new hires to understand meetings/etc more quickly
			\item Reviewed many design documents and pull requests, feedback included hard stuff like "we really just shouldn't do this"
			\item Acted as a consultant/liason between infra and metrics, implemented stuff like automated node rotation
			\item Contributed heavily to build/deployment tooling to help make managing 40+ Helm charts not a headache for the metrics devs
			\item Did all the usual ops stuff -- worked with cloud providers for instance capacity, improved resource utilization by binpacking containers, created TF modules, ran disaster tests, got way too familiar with Kafka
			\item Did all the usual dev stuff -- created and deployed patches, optimized database sharding, participated in on call rotation, etc

		\textbf{ACTIONIQ} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Distributed Systems Engineer \hfill Jun 18 -- Apr 20
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Designed, advocated for, and implemented our strategy for autoscaling query execution on EC2, reducing our AWS bill by more than 50\%
			\item Drove scalability improvements for the OSS job scheduling platform Luigi, and contributed some of that back upstream
			\item Maintained the Prometheus cluster (later, Datadog) and led internal talks and workshops on best practices around metrics \& observability
			\item Enabled dynamic configuration and artifact discovery
			\item Brought some of the first Terraform modules to AIQ, used them to build \linebreak the first version of our streaming ingest platform using IaC

		\textbf{EDU.CHAT} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Software Engineering Intern \hfill Jun 17 -- Aug 17
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Worked closely with a team of three other engineers, using JIRA and Git, to create a bot which classified and answered student questions
			\item Developed, refined, tested and integrated the new NLP question-matching model with the overall Edu.Chat platform
			\item Learned Python implementations for message passing, parallelization and task queue systems to distribute the workload (like Celery and Redis)
