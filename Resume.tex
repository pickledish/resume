		\textbf{DATADOG} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Site Reliability Engineer \hfill May 2020 -- Jun 2023
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Kicked off several reliability initiatives, including founding a group to lead weekly metrics-wide incident learnings, unified SLI tracking, and running personally many production-readiness reviews
			% \item Started MRE
			\item Operated fully in both platform \& product, building many custom platform features to improve service reliability and dev workflows
			% \item Identified 80/20 solutions in delivering delicate configuration to dozens of services simultaneously -- two months of work allowed a whole team over a year of space to design a real replacement
			\item Completed adoption of the new Kubernetes platform in metrics, migrating some of Datadog's largest + most complicated services (the primary TSDB, the primary public LB) without downtime
			\item Identified (and saw to completion) several cost-efficiency projects, like the improvement of pod resource limits and bin-packing
			\item Hosted architecture overview sessions, for 1-10 people, to help new hires feel empowered (instead of confused) as quickly as possible
			% \item Reviewed many design documents and pull requests, feedback included hard stuff like "we really just shouldn't do this"
			\item Contributed heavily to IaC, CI, and automation workflows, so product devs could mostly ignore their services' 40+ Helm charts
			%\item Did all the usual ops stuff -- worked with cloud providers for instance capacity, improved resource utilization by binpacking containers, created TF modules, ran disaster tests, got way too familiar with Kafka
			%\item Did all the usual dev stuff -- created and deployed patches, optimized database sharding, participated in on call rotation, etc

		\textbf{ACTIONIQ} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Distributed Systems Engineer \hfill Jun 2018 -- Apr 2020
		\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=4pt]
			\item Designed, advocated for, and implemented the procedure for autoscaling query execution on EC2, reducing our AWS bill by more than 50\%
			\item Drove scalability improvements for the OSS job scheduling platform Luigi, and contributed some of that back upstream
			\item Maintained the Prometheus cluster (later, Datadog) and led internal talks and workshops on best practices around metrics and observability
			\item Enabled dynamic configuration updates with Ansible
			\item Brought some of the first Terraform modules to AIQ, used them to build \linebreak the first version of our streaming ingest platform using IaC

		\textbf{EDU.CHAT} \hfill \textit{New York, NY}\\
		Software Engineering Intern \hfill Jun 2017 -- Aug 2017

			\item Learned Python implementations for message passing, parallelization and task queue systems to distribute the workload (like Celery and Redis)
